# Ads1015_esp8266

A library to use ADS1015 12-bit ADC along with esp8266 MCUs.

## Notice

This implementation uses the library [brzo_i2c](https://github.com/pasko-zh/brzo_i2c) instead of Wire for reliable I2C comunication at fast mode speeds.
It makes the code dependent of esp8266 MCUs !!!

## Prerequisites

You must install [brzo_i2c](https://github.com/pasko-zh/brzo_i2c) library in order for this to work.

## Fixed values

The ADS1015 is always operated in continuous conversion operating mode and comparator disabled. For further information consult TIÂ´s [ADS1015 datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/ADS1015).

I2C software communication between master and slave is allways made at 400kHz clock speed.

## Functions

Providing you ```#include <Ads1015_esp8266.h>``` library in your sketch then just instantiate an object of type:

```Ads1015_esp8266  myName(uint8_t Address);``` where Address is one of the following slave addresses:

* 0x48	address pin of ADS1015 connected to GND
* 0x49	...pin connected to VCC
* 0x50	...pin connected to SDA
* 0x51	...pin connected to SCL

then you will have five functions available: ```begin```, ```selectInput```, ```selectGain```, ```selectRate``` and ```readConversion```.

### begin

The very first function you will have to call in order to start continuous conversion and correctly setup software I2C comunication with slave ADS1015.

```
begin(uint8_t sda, uint8_t scl);
```
Input
* SDA pin in your esp8266.
* SCL pin...

Return
* None

Example: Start conversions and setup I2C communication using NodeMCU V1.0 ```begin(D2, D1);```
